            Hi!  Thank you so much for stopping by my little corner on the internet!  My name is Manny!  I originally created this to help me look for work, but I am no longer seeking employment so I don't know what to do with this space other than leave it up!
            <br />

            I a currently a student at Hack Reactor while going through training for an apprenticeship at the Next Chapter organization.

            <br />
            I love you all and there is nothing you can do about it!

/*          <p>
            In my search for meaningful employment, I have tried to look for jobs that I feel would really resonate with
            me. I am fascinated with technology and where things are moving. I was a computer science major before
            moving here to Kentucky, and although I do not have much work experience in this field, I am passionate
            about it. I feel like I am proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, and the MERN stack for front end. I am
            currently finishing up the boot camp I am attending with the Python/Django curriculum.

            <br/>
             I have a decade of
            experience dealing with people, and sometimes in very tense and high intensity situations, and as a result
            Iâ€™ve gotten very good at finding different ways to articulate things to have meaningful or effective
            interactions with others. . I also have a certification from the National Institute for Automotive Service
            Excellence for electrical work, and as such I have a very strong understanding of electrical concepts and it
            gives me unique perspective on troubleshooting. With my passion for information technology, and my people
            skills I feel I would make a valuable addition to your team. Thank you for taking the time to visit! */
